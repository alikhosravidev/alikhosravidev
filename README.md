# Hi, I am Ali 👋
I started working in web and programming since 2016, most of my work experience is remote work, I always try to learn new things and improve every day.
I started web programming with the front-end and in most of the projects I did, I developed the front-end part. Besides HTML, CSS, I have a good command of frameworks such as Bootstrap and jQuery, and I am also familiar with preprocessors.

I started learning back-end by participating in 7Learn PHP expert course, and I am still eager to learn new things.
I am very interested in the concepts of object orientation, my favorite framework is Laravel, and most of my portfolios are programmed with this framework.
I did some projects with WordPress and PHP Pure and I was not limited to Laravel.

# I'm ready for remote projects
